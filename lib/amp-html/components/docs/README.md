## Installing Components

AMP-HTML makes it easy to add new feature-sets with components without bloating your app right from the beginning.

You can install any component by running:

    amp-html install NAME

So running `amp-html install analytics` will install the AMP-HTML Analytics component.

You can view all currently installed components in your AMP-HTML configuration file (`config/amp-html.yml`).

After editing the list of components in your configuration run:

    amp-html bundle

to install all added and uninstall all removed components.

**Now you are ready to use your added components.**
To learn more about the features of a specific component, take a look at their dedicated references.

To update your configuration file after new components got added to AMP-HTML run:

    rails g amp_html:install


## About Components

AMP-HTML components are an easy way to use AMP and Rails to build slim, performant and powerful applications. They allow to add the exact superpower or feature your app needs. You stay in control of what features your app uses and which not.

### What features are components?

The vanilla version of AMP-HTML comes just with everything you need to get you and your app started with AMP. To really profit from all the features that AMP-HTML provides, you need to install components. Some components like "Iframe" or "Animated Images" are considerably smaller than others like "Authentication" and "Notifications". You decide which components your app needs.

### DeepIntegration Components

DeepIntegration components are usually larger, more complex components, that integrate more deeply into your app. They often provide options to get configured in your AMP-HTML configuration file (`config/amp-html.yml`) and / or they require to be setup in your view. You can learn more about whether a certain component has DeepIntegration or not by looking at their dedicated references.

### Availability of Components

The availability of components summarizes whether a component is included in the vanilla version of AMP-HTML or if it needs to be installed in order to get used.
