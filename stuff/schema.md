## Configuration

In your AMP-HTML configuration (`config/amp-html.yml`) search for the section of the App Customization.

There you can specify some information about your app:

    name: "MyApp"
    type: "Organization"
    date_published: "2015-10-07T12:02:41Z"
    image: ["logo.jpg"]

You can override each of these values by passing a different value to the `schema_tag`.


## Usage

In your views you can setup analytics as follows:

    <%= schema_tag %>

By default it takes the configured values in your AMP-HTML configuration:

    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
        "@context": "http://schema.org",
        "@type": "Organization",
        "headline": "MyApp",
        "datePublished": "2015-10-07T12:02:41Z",
        "image": [
            "logo.jpg"
        ]
    }
    </script>

You can override values:

    <%= schema_tag(headline: "Open-source framework for publishing content", type: "NewsArticle", image: ["cover.jpg"]) %>

You can also add new information:

    <%= schema_tag(address: "PO Box 7775, San Francisco", email: "email@example.com") %>
