Reliable high-:zap: apps with AMP & Rails.

amp-html is a universal solution to integrate the [AMP Project](https://www.ampproject.org/) into your Rails app with ease. It enables you to quickly spin-up, build and test your app with AMP, while fulfilling the app's unique requirements. It comes with a bunch of superpowers like user authentication, notifications, blogs, animations and support for assets in AMP.

Use the powerful features of AMP to make your Rails app consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing across devices and distribution platforms.

### Deprecations

Deprecations are combined with new major releases of amp-html. You can see a full list of past and future deprecations [here](DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Installation

You can also follow the [**Getting Started Guide**](https://github.com/jonhue/amp-html/wiki/Getting-started).

amp-html works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'amp-html'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install amp-html

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'amp-html', github: 'jonhue/amp-html'
```

Now generate the files necessary:

    $ rails g mozaic:install
    $ rails g amp_html

Replace the contents of your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` file with:

```haml
= amp_mozaic do
    = yield
```

Lastly, make sure to remove Turbolinks from your apps asset pipeline (`app/assets/javascripts/application.js`) as it does not work well with AMP.
